So, I've actually always found something that to be very true, which is most people don't get those experiences because they've never asked, I've never found anybody that didn't want to help me. If I asked him for help, I always call them up. I called up, this will date me, but I called it Bill Hewlett when I was 12 years old and he lived in Palo Alto. His number was still on the phone book and he answered the phone himself it out. Yes said hi, I'm Steve Jobs. I'm 12 years old, I'm
 student in high school and I want to build a frequency counter and I was wondering if you had any spare parts, I could have and he laughed and he gave me the spare parts to build his frequency counter. And he gave me a job that summer in Hewlett-Packard working on the assembly line, putting nuts, and bolts together on frequency counters. He got me a job in the place that built them and I was in heaven and I've never found anyone who said, no or hung up the phone when I called I just asked and when people ask me, I try to be as responsive, you know, to pay
 That debt of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone and call most people never ask and that's what separates sometimes. The people who do things from the people that just dream about them, got it, you gotta act and you've got to be willing to fail, you've got to be willing to crash and burn, you know, with people on the phone with starting a company with whatever. If you're afraid of failing, you won't get very far.
